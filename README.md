# futuregeeks.tv

This is the future home of futuregeeks.tv.  
We'll be designing and developing this publicly, so expect to see lots of changes and few bugs ;)

#### Requirements

At least [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/) 1.9.3 and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

#### Project Setup

You first need to install the project's Ruby dependencies. From the root directory, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

#### Running

To run the project:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

The site will now be available at `http://localhost:4000`. Jekyll will watch for changes in the project and reload them.
